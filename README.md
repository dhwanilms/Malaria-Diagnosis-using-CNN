# Malaria-Diagnosis-using-CNN
Classifying cell images into infected and uninfected using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Convolutional Neural Networks

## Motivation

## Goal

## Requirements
This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python  which already has the above packages and more included. However if you wish to run it online rather than your local machine you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) which also has the necessary packages installed.
